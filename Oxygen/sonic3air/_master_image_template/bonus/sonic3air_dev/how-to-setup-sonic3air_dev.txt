
Getting started with the development version of Sonic 3 A.I.R.:

- (No extra steps required here any more)

- Just switch to the "bonus/oxygenengine" folder, and start the Oxygen App executable there.
	That's "OxygenApp.exe" under Windows, or "oxygenapp_linux" under Linux.
	This engine application is a development environment useful for testing and debugging S3AIR script code.



Now you have a functional development installation.
As next steps, make sure to read the documentation, namely:

- The Modding Manual at "doc/Modding.pdf" in the S3AIR game installation.

- The Oxygen Engine Handbook at "bonus/oxygenengine/Handbook.pdf" covering details especially for scripting.
