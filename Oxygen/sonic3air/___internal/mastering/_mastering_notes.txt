
Mastering Packaged Builds
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°


Preparations for all versions
	- Build S3AIR for your current working platform (e.g. when you're on Windows and intend to build for Android, first build S3AIR for Windows)
		- See the respective "how-to-build.txt" file inside your platform's subfolder of "Oxygen/sonic3air/build" (e.g. "_vstudio" for Windows, "_cmake" for Linux)
	- After that, build the game scripts once by starting S3AIR as a Release build
	- Review the version number in "Oxygen/sonic3air/source/sonic3air/version.inc"


Windows (using Visual Studio)
	- Do the preparation steps above
	- For a 32-bit build: Execute "mastering_windows_32bit.bat"
	- For a 64-bit build: Execute "mastering_windows_64bit.bat"
	- The resulting package can be found inside "Oxygen/_MASTER"


Linux
	- Do the preparation steps above
	- Execute "mastering_linux.sh" (can be done in a VM, in WSL, or of course on a real Linux installation)
	- The resulting package can be found inside "Oxygen/_MASTER" (testing should definitely be done in a real Linux installation)


Android
	- Do the preparation steps above, incl. building S3AIR for your current working platform (Windows, Linux) first
	- Build the package data
		- On Windows: Execute one of the "mastering_build_data_*.bat" scripts (both produce the same results)
		- On Linux: You can the "mastering_linux.sh" script, though it does a bit more than just creating the package data
		- In any case, the resulting data will be written to "Oxygen/sonic3air/_master_image_template/data"
	- Copy all required data to the Android data folder
		- See "source/_android/readme_how-to-build.txt" for what to copy
		- On Windows, you can use the "mastering_android.bat" script to do the copying
	- Open the project at "Oxygen/sonic3air/build/_android" in Android Studio
	- Review "source/_android/app/build.gradle"
		- Update the version number here as well
		- Make sure the abiFilters and other settings are correct
	- Build a signed APK via Menu -> Build -> "Generate Signed Bundle / APK..."
		- APK
		- Use your keystore (the official S3AIR one is not publicly available)
		- Build as "release" with both signature versions enabled
