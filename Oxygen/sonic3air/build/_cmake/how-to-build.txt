
=== Build under Linux ===

Make sure the following packages are installed.
If needed, install them via "sudo apt-get install" (for Debian-based systems, this may differ for other Linux distributions).
	- g++
	- cmake
	- libgl1-mesa-dev
	- libglu1-mesa-dev
	- libasound2-dev
	- libpulse-dev
	- libxcomposite-dev
	- libxxf86vm-dev
	=> Complete line to copy:   sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libxcomposite-dev libxxf86vm-dev
	=> More candidates that might be needed by SDL2 see https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/3bdc10f842c3eba74b9837caa21339a68a19efbe/.github/workflows/main.yml

Setup and build with CMake:
	- cd ./Oxygen/sonic3air/source/_cmake/build
	- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	- cmake --build .



=== Run Linux Builds ===

For both, place a copy of the S3&K ROM "Sonic_Knuckles_wSonic3.bin" inside "Oxygen/sonic3air/___internal".

Run S3AIR:
	- cd Oxygen/sonic3air
	- ./sonic3air_linux

Run Oxygen:
	- cd Oxygen/oxygenengine
	- ./oxygenapp_linux
