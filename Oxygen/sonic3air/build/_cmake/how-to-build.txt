NOTE: For ENDUSER builds you might need to build a non-ENDUSER build and pack before being able to build any of these versions

=== Build under Linux ===

Make sure the following packages are installed.
If needed, install them via "sudo apt-get install" (for Debian-based systems, this may differ for other Linux distributions).
	- g++
	- cmake
	- libgl1-mesa-dev
	- libglu1-mesa-dev
	- libasound2-dev
	- libpulse-dev
	- libxcomposite-dev
	- libxxf86vm-dev
	=> Complete line to copy:   sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libxcomposite-dev libxxf86vm-dev
	=> More candidates that might be needed by SDL2 see https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/3bdc10f842c3eba74b9837caa21339a68a19efbe/.github/workflows/main.yml

Setup and build with CMake:
	- cd ./Oxygen/sonic3air/source/_cmake/build
	- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	- cmake --build .



=== Run Linux Builds ===

For both, place a copy of the S3&K ROM "Sonic_Knuckles_wSonic3.bin" inside "Oxygen/sonic3air/___internal".

NOTE: If you are running in Wayland, you may need to set variable SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11

Run S3AIR:
	- cd Oxygen/sonic3air
	- ./sonic3air_linux

Run Oxygen:
	- cd Oxygen/oxygenengine
	- ./oxygenapp_linux

=== Build for Nintendo Switch ===
Apart from switch-dev(which you should already have installed), you need SDL2, Vorbis, minizip, zlib(double check if we really need this), libglad, pkg-config and cmake(and maybe some other package, please tell me if I do). Install them by:

	- sudo (dkp-)pacman -S switch-sdl2 switch-libvorbis switch-minizip switch-zlib switch-glad switch-pkg-config switch-cmake

Afterwards:
	- mkdir build && cd build
	- $DEVKITPRO/portlibs/switch/bin/aarch64-none-elf-cmake ..
	- make -j$(nproc)

The nro will be at the root of the build directory, make sure to run it inside a folder with the rest of the files needed, see _master-image-template.
