
Preparation:
	- You might need to first go through the preparation steps as listed in "Oxygen/sonic3air/_internal/mastering/_mastering_notes.txt"
	- Go to "app/src/main/assets" and copy from the sonic3air main directory:
		- data (you can leave out the audio data to make builds faster during development)
		- scripts
		- config.json


Build with Android Studio:
	- Open Android Studio
	- Open this directory as project
	- Review "abiFilters" setting in "app/build.gradle"
		- For development it may be set to just one architecture to avoid long build times
		- For final builds, either disable the setting or enable all four target architectures
	- Let Gradle do its sync, then Make, and Run
