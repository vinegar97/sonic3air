
Preparation:
- Go to "app/src/main/assets" and copy from the sonic3air main directory:
	- data (you can leave out the audio data to make builds faster during development)
	- scripts
	- config.json


Build with Android Studio:
- Open Android Studio (last tested with version 4.1.1)
- Open this directory as project
- Review "abiFilters" setting in "app/build.gradle"
	- For development it may be set to just one architecture to avoid long build times
	- For final builds, either disable the setting or enable all four target architectures
- Let Gradle do its sync, then Make, and Run
