
=== Build for Windows with Visual Studio 2022 ===


Using the build script
	- Just execute "build_zlib.bat" and you're done


Alternative: Manual build
	- Uses a custom Visual Studio Solution "_vstudio/zlib.sln"
	- Static Build
	- Build as Debug + Release, for x86 + x64
	- Afterwards execute "copy_libvorbis.bat" to copy headers and libs in place


Fixes to apply after updating
	- In "zlib\contrib\minizip\ioapi.c":
		- Add include "#include <stdio.h>"
		- Append " || defined(ANDROID) || defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)" in line 17 (or line 19 with the include above)
