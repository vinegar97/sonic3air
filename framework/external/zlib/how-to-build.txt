Using the build script
	- Just execute "build_zlib.bat" and you're done


Alternative: Manual build
	- Uses a custom Visual Studio Solution "_vstudio/zlib.sln"
	- Static Build
	- Build as Debug + Release, for x86 + x64
	- Afterwards execute "copy_libvorbis.bat" to copy headers and libs in place


Fixes to apply after updating
	- There's a whole bunch of changes for minizip required, especially for Android and Web builds - see manual changes after last update
