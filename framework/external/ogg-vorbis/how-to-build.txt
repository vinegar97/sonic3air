			- Changes in the Project Properties required for static build, for all configurations:
				- C/C++ -> Code Generation -> "Runtime Library" = "Multi-threaded (/MT)"
				- C/C++ -> Code Generation -> "Enable Function-Level Linking" = "Yes"
		- Build as Debug + Release (for static build), for x86 + x64
		- Afterwards execute "copy_libogg.bat" to copy headers and libs in place
	- libvorbis
		- Visual Studio Solution in "ogg-vorbis\libvorbis\win32\VS2010"
