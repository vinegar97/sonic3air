This is taken directly from the jsoncpp Github repository:
https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/

You can find more information, its license etc. right there.

Note that the library is reduced to only what's needed by librmx.

Also there's small changes in this distribution here, namely that all includes like
	#include <json/*.h>
got changed to
	#include "json/*.h"
